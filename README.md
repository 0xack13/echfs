# echfs

The echfs filesystem is a 64-bit FAT-like filesystem which aims to support
most UNIX and POSIX-style features while being extremely simple to implement.
Ideal for hobbyist OS developers who want a simple filesystem and don't want
to deal with old crufty FAT (which isn't UNIX/POSIX compliant either),
or complex filesystems such as ext2/3/4.
